📌 Task-1: Decision Tree Classification
📖 Description

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to perform supervised classification on a structured dataset.
The model learns decision rules from the data and predicts the target class based on feature values.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Google Colab / VS Code (Jupyter Notebook /python)

📂 Dataset

A sample dataset containing categorical features was used.
All categorical attributes were encoded using Label Encoding before training the model.

⚙️ Implementation Steps

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Encoded categorical features using Label Encoder

Split the data into features and target variable

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier

Visualized the decision tree structure

Generated predictions and evaluated model performance

📊 Results

The Decision Tree successfully classified the dataset

Decision rules were visualized for better interpretability

Model predictions matched actual class labels
